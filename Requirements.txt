I have created a new branch posts_user to mess around with what we've got working
to try and get the index to show all posts from all users.


Memberships
* User should see link for Basic plan on home page
* User should see link for Pro plan on home page
* Basic plan link should point to reqular Devise sign up form
* Pro plan link should point to a custom sign up form

Stripe Integrations
* Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table.
* Javascript should prevent pro form from submitting after user fills it out, 
and should send card info to stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
* Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app.  Rails app
should validate the user fields.  Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info(email, plan id) and card token 
to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
toekn.  Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.

User Profiles
* Each user should have one profile
* User should see link to new profile form upon signing up
* User should be able to create and view their user profile
* User profile should have a profile picture
* User should be able to view all user profiles
